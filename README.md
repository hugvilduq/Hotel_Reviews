# Sentiment Analysis on Hotel Reviews
## Project Overview
This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis on hotel reviews. The goal is to collect, clean, and analyze review data to develop a machine learning model that can predict the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of the reviews. The project involves three key stages: data collection, data cleaning, and building a sentiment analysis machine learning model.

Requirements
To run this project, you will need the following libraries installed:

Python 3.x
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
BeautifulSoup (for web scraping, if required)
Matplotlib and Seaborn (for data visualization)
TensorFlow or PyTorch (optional for deep learning models)
You can install all dependencies by running:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Data Collection
Source:
Hotel reviews can be collected from various sources, such as:

Web scraping hotel booking platforms (e.g., TripAdvisor, Booking.com).
Public datasets from sources like Kaggle (e.g., TripAdvisor hotel reviews dataset).
The data_collection.py script provides methods to scrape or load datasets.

Steps:
Scrape hotel review data (if necessary) or download from a public dataset.
Save the collected data in a CSV or JSON file for further processing.
Example:

python
Copy code
python data_collection.py
Data Cleaning
Raw data may contain noise, missing values, or irrelevant information. The data_cleaning.py script handles data preprocessing, which includes:

Removing duplicates
Filling or removing missing values
Normalizing text (removing punctuation, converting to lowercase)
Tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization using NLTK or SpaCy
Encoding sentiment labels (e.g., Positive = 1, Negative = 0)
Example:

python
Copy code
python data_cleaning.py
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA is conducted to understand the data's structure and to generate insights. This step involves visualizing the distribution of sentiments, word frequencies, and performing basic text analysis. Use the eda.py script for:

Plotting sentiment distribution
Creating word clouds of common terms
Checking word count per review
Example:

python
Copy code
python eda.py
Model Training
For sentiment analysis, several machine learning models can be used, including:

Naive Bayes
Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Random Forest
Deep Learning models (LSTM, BERT)
The model_training.py script contains the process of training the model. It includes:

Vectorization: Use TF-IDF or Word2Vec for text vectorization.
Model Training: Train the machine learning model using labeled data.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Apply GridSearchCV or RandomSearch for optimizing hyperparameters.
Example:

python
Copy code
python model_training.py
Evaluation
After training, the model is evaluated using various metrics:

Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-Score
Confusion Matrix
The evaluation script (evaluation.py) will output the model’s performance on the test dataset.

Example:

python
Copy code
python evaluation.py
How to Run
Collect Data: If you don’t have a dataset, collect it using data_collection.py.
Clean Data: Run the data_cleaning.py script to prepare the data.
EDA: Perform Exploratory Data Analysis with eda.py.
Train Model: Train the model using model_training.py.
Evaluate: Evaluate model performance with evaluation.py.
